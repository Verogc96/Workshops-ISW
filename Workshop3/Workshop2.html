				<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
				<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML forms the base of any website as HTML contains the information about the document and tells the browser what is the data on the page in terms of text, links, and also directs the browsers where to find images.</p>
			</section>

				<h3>Differences</h3>	
				<ul>
					<li>HTML4 is supported by many third-party elements like Silverlight and flash and HTML5 is supported by many third-party elements like Silverlight and flash.</li>
					<li>There is no provision for new tags in HTML 4 and It allows new tags like video, canvas, audio, and others and HTML5 allows new tags like video, canvas, audio, and others.</li>
					<li>HTML 4 uses "< acronym >" tag to display abbreviations of the web browser while HTML5 uses "< abbr >" tag to display the abbreviations in the web browser.</li>
					<li>HTML 4 is established and standard and is compatible with numerous different web-browsers HTML 5 is evolving and is not compatible with different browsers.</li>
					<li>In HTML 4, the "< meta >" tag contains the schema attribute of the HTML document while in HTML 5, the "< mera >" tag defines the header section of the HTML document.</li>	
					<li>HTML 4 has no "< canvas >" tags while HTML 5 has introduced "< canvas >" tags which is used to draw graphics using JavaScript.</li>
					<li>In HTML 4 the table tag has several attributes while in HTML 5, the table tag has only one attribute that is the border.</li>

				<h3>What is HTML5?</h3>
				<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML forms the base of any website as HTML contains the information about the document and tells the browser what is the data on the page in terms of text, links, and also directs the browsers where to find images.</p>

				<h3>Features</h3>
					<h4>New Semantic Elements</h4>
					<p>HTML5 introduced several new semantically meaningful tags. These include < section >, < header >, < footer > < nav >, < mark >, < figure >, < aside > < figcaption >, < data >, < time>, < output >, < progress >, < meter > and < main >. These make it easier to write cleaner code that clearly delineates style from content, which is particularly important to users with assistive technologies like screen readers.</p>

					<h4>Inline SVG</h4>
					<p>Using HTML4, you’d need Flash, Silverlight, or another technology to add scalable vector graphics (SVGs) to your web pages. With HTML5, you can add vector graphics directly in HTML documents using the < svg > tag. You can also draw rectangles, circles, text, and other vector-based paths and shapes using this new element. Below is an example of a circular shape created using the SVG < circle > element.</p>

					<h4>Form Features</h4>
					<p>You can create smarter forms thanks to HTML5’s expanded form options. In addition to all the standard form input types, HTML5 offers more, including: datetime, datetime-local, date, month, week, time, number, range, email, and url. You can also add date pickers, sliders, validation, and placeholder text thanks to the new placeholder attribute, which we’ll discuss later.</p>

					<h4>WebM Video Format</h4>
					<p>Before HTML5, you needed browser plugins to embed audio and video content into web pages. Not only did HTML5 introduce < audio > and < video > tags which eliminated the need for browser plugins, it also introduced the WebM video format. This is a royalty-free video format developed by Google that provides a great compression to quality ratio. This can be used with the video element and is supported by most browsers.</p>

					<h4>Placeholder Attribute</h4>
					<p>HTML5 introduced the placeholder attribute. You can use this with the < input > element to provide a short hint to help users fill in passwords or other data entry fields. This can help you create better forms. However, it’s important to note that this attribute is not accessible to assistive technologies. Feel free to read more about the problems with the placeholder attribute.</p>

					<h4>Server-sent Events</h4>
					<p>A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updated data from a server. This was possible with HTML4, but the web page would have to ask.
						HTML5 supports one-way server-sent events. That means, data is continuously sent from a server to the browser. Think of how useful this would be if your website included stock prices, news feeds, Twitter feeds, and so on. Server-sent events were supported in the previous version of HTML, but the web page would have to repeatedly request it.</p>

					<h4>Local Web Storage</h4>
					<p>With the previous version of HTML, data is stored locally via cookies. With HTML5, web storage is used in place of cookies thanks to a scripting API. This allows you to store data locally, like cookies, but in much larger quantities.
						Now that we understand what’s new in HTML5, let’s take a look at why you should be using it on your website.</p>
